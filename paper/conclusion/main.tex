We created the largest dataset for evaluating book success, and presented a novel study of semantic word association of a book's content to predict its success.
Our empirical results demonstrate that semantic word association and its related thematic concepts are very useful in capturing a bookâ€™s literary content and can predict a book's success with better accuracy.  
Rather than individual word frequency, the set of words with similar meaning has been proved to be most effective.
%We presented the best quantitative model for predicting book success based on the semantic relations given its genre.
The analysis performed in this project demonstrates the relationship between thematic word groups and a book's popularity, with our best models achieving a prediction accuracy of 95.4\%.
Finally, we illustrated that readers expect certain themes to be prioritized over others based on a book's genre, and the proper use of those themes directly contributes to a book's popularity.
