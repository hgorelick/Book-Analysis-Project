\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future work}

The discoveries made in our research are just the beginning of what can be done with our dataset.
In addition to the data utilized for this project, we also extracted bi-gram and context-free grammar production features from each book.
In future work, we will continue to explore the impact of these features in addition to semantic word associations on book success.

We also believe that we could achieve better results through the use of a different success surrogate metric.
The scale of Project Gutenberg's catalog does not correspond to the website's popularity.
Therefore, as we continue this work we will include ratings from popular sites such as Goodreads.com, Amazon, etc. to acquire a even more accurate measurement of success~\cite{goodreads}.
