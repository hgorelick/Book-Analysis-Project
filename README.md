# Book Analysis Project
In this project, we analyzed the text from 18,000 books in order to predict and interpret the success of each book.
Currently, the project is not configured to be run anywhere, and needs some cleaning up.
If you want to use the dataset, or have any questions about the code/project, please contact me. I'm happy to help/share/explain however I can!

*The dataset is not currently accessible, this will be updated once we've found a place for it online.*
